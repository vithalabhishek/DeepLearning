# Deep  Learning

Libraries Used :

1. NumPy : NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Numpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays.

## NumPy Installation On Windows Operating System

Python is not installed by default in windows operating system. You can download the required version of python from python.org. Once python is installed successfully, open command prompt and use pip to install numpy.

## NumPy Installation On Mac and Linux Operating System

Mac and Linux users can install NumPy via pip command:
pip install numpy

 Command is : !pip3 install numpy
 
2. Pandas : Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools. Unlike NumPy library which provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas provides in-memory 2d table object called Dataframe.

In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. 

## Prefer pip?

Pandas can be installed via pip from PyPI.

pip install pandas

## Installation instructions

1. Download Anaconda for your operating system and the latest Python version, run the installer, and follow the steps. Please note:

It is not needed (and discouraged) to install Anaconda as root or administrator.
 > When asked if you wish to initialize Anaconda3, answer yes.
 > Restart the terminal after completing the installation.
 > Detailed instructions on how to install Anaconda can be found in the Anaconda documentation: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

2. In the Anaconda prompt (or terminal in Linux or MacOS), start JupyterLab.

3. In JupyterLab, create a new (Python 3) notebook.

4. In the first cell of the notebook, you can import pandas and check the version with : 
import pandas
pandas.__version__

5. Now you are ready to use pandas, and you can write your code in the next cells.
